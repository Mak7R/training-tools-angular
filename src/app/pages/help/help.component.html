  <h3>Exercises Page:</h3>

    The Exercises page is accessible even to non-registered users. Here, anyone can view all available exercises. Users with administrative privileges have the additional capability to add or remove exercises.
  </p>

  <h3>Users Page:</h3>
  <p>
    The Users page displays a comprehensive list of all registered users. Admin users can perform several actions here, including sending friendship requests, creating new users, and managing existing user accounts (edit, delete).
  </p>

  <h3>Groups Page:</h3>
  <p>
    Exclusive to administrators, the Groups page allows management of user groups. This includes viewing existing groups, adding new ones, modifying group details, and deleting groups when necessary.

    On the Friends page, users can manage their social connections. This includes canceling pending friend requests, accepting or rejecting received requests, and viewing their current list of friends.

    The Profile page serves as a central hub for user information management. Here, users can update their profile details, delete their account if needed, and adjust their profile visibility settings. The visibility can be set to either Public (visible to all) or Private (visible only to friends and administrators).
  </p>

  <h3>Logout Page:</h3>

    Clicking on the Logout page will securely sign the user out of their current session, ensuring privacy and account security.
